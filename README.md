# 3HOLLIS — reboot

This repository has been reset for a fresh start.

## Current status
- Single-page placeholder (`index.html`) renders a full-black canvas with minimal launch text.

## Local development
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Serve the directory with any static HTTP server, for example:

```zsh
cd /path/to/3hollis.com
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:8080> to view the page.

## Next steps
- Flesh out the visual direction for the reboot.
- Add assets, styles, and additional pages once the new concept is ready.
